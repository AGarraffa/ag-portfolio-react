    <div class="about-bio">
        <p class="bio">A native New Yorker, I went to Hartwick College in Oneonta, NY for two years prior to transferring to UMASS, Amherst and graduated with a BS in Geology in 2004. After College I decided to try something new and move to Boulder, CO. After about 3 years my feet began to itch and I decided to take a job teaching English in South Korea. I spent a year there and then was admitted to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology to obtain my Master's degree in geology focusing primarily on metamorphic petrology. While there I had the opportunity to conduct my thesis research over the course of 6 weeks in Orhaneli, Turkey. After graduate school, I took a job in Denver, CO and have been here ever since.</p><br><p class="bio">Throughout college and while living in Colorado I worked at various bike shops before working as a core analyst for Core Laboratories. During graduate school I was able to aid with a seasonal groundwater study with the USGS as well as interning with El Paso Energy (later purchased by Kinder Morgan) workong on well prospecting using well log analysis and 3D seismic mapping. Upon graduating I began working as an operations geologist for various oil and gas companies. Coding and software development has always been a blind spot for me, and I am currently enrolled in Denver University's coding bootcamp to broaden my professional opportunites.</p><br><p class="bio">Outside of work and academia I have always enjoyed being outside; hiking, climbing, cycling, and most recently learning to fly paramotors. Geology always provided a special opportunity to explore some fairly rugged landscapes which explains my fascination with it over the years.</p>
